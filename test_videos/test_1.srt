1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,980
損さ悲しみを言う!

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,759
自分らしさを力に迷いながらでもいい

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,780
See  you  guys!

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,899
Y  Mono  Daniela

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,900
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,920
Oh,  yeah,  yeah

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,659
Let's  see.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280
Mo -e -e -e -e -e -e!

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,739

Uchiha  do  I  frighten  you  are  you

11
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,719
shocked  by  my  true  form  why  do  you  run  and  hide

12
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:53,980
why

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,180
Why  do  you  always  run  away?

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,740
Come  on!

15
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,340
It's  to  me!

16
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:14,719
It's  to  me!

17
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,819
Come  on!

18
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,419
Yeah!

19
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,020
Get  it!

20
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,180
Come  on!

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,939
You  can  do  it!

22
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,840
That  was  awesome!

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,759
Come  on!

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,719
It's  him!

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,280
Here.

26
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,860
It's  that  Gaara!

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,979
He's  really...

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,979
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,599
Yeah.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,719
Thank  you.

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Thank  you.

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's  go.

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,300
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

34
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,879
I  won't  let  you  get  away,  you  can't  escape,  do

35
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,639
you  hear,  Sasuke  Uchiha?

36
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,300
We're  in  it.

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,620
Thank  you.

38
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,439
Hold  on!

39
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,860
Why  me?

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,600
on  me.

41
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,339
Yes.

42
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,040
Thank  you.

43
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,680
so  lonely

44
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,079
Thank  you.

45
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,699
a  minute  here.

46
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,139
Here  we  go.

47
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,259
in  Sasuke's  eyes.

48
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,439
Be  careful.

49
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,279
You  may  not  be  able  to  read  him

50
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,199
as  well  as  you  think.

51
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,839
When  we  finally  fight,  it  won't  be  to  advance  to

52
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:06,980
the  next...

53
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,639
One

54
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,800
one  standing  will  feel  the  full  value  of  his

55
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:19,980
existence.

56
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
what  you  want,  too.

57
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,139
You  want  to  confirm  the  value  of  your  existence,

58
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,980
don't  you?  To  know  if  you're  truly

59
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,740
Your  existence  is  stronger.  Yours,  or  the  one

60
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,920
facing  you  with  murder  in  his  eyes.

61
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,560
Thank  you.

62
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,980
and  sense  of  pur -

63
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,920
OBJECT  FEAR!

64
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,519
that  of  a  coward!  Come  out  and  fight  me!  Show  me

65
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,200
that  I'm  wrong!  Prove  that  your  existence

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,779
YOU 'LL  NEVER  FEEL  IT!

67
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,700
ATTACK!

68
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Thank  you.

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,559
Reason.

70
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,620
Shh!

71
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,980
himself  the  guilt

72
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,539
I  NEED  TO  BE  THE  ONE  TO  KILL  HIM!

73
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,639
Thank  you.

74
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
Looks  like  it  worked!

75
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,879
I  see!  So  that's  what  it  is!

76
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:22,600
Amazing!

77
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,899
Ah!

78
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,779
Ah!

79
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:29,659
Ah!

80
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,220
Ah!

81
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,860
Looking  forward  to  this,  this  pain.

82
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,279
an  opponent  capable  of  wounding  me  so  badly!  Such

83
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:47,740
a  victory!

84
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,500
No  one  has  ever  wounded  Gaara.

85
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,879
fiber  of  his  body.  For  all  Gata's  strength,  it's

86
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,019
only  his  right  arm  that's  been  transformed.

87
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,039
There's  more.  So  much  more!

88
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,080
What  the  hell  is  this  guy?

89
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,740
How  many  of  these  things  are  going  to  grow  out

90
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,059
of  him?

91
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,220
What?

92
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,360
We  won't  do  it!

93
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,980
This  level

94
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,639
You're  finished!

95
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,360
You

96
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,940
You

97
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,899
Oh

98
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,919
I

99
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,440
You

100
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,440
BATTLE!

101
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,879
but  costly  using

102
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,159
Don't  sweat  it,  I'm  actually  very  impressed.

103
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,379
empty

104
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,600
more  than  twice.

105
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,700
Well,  for  one  thing,

106
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,620
Not  only  will  it  not  work,  but  the  attempt  can

107
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:07,820
drain

108
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,340
die.

109
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,580
Even  if  the  worst  doesn't  happen,  nothing  good  can

110
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,139
come  of  it.

111
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,340
Ah

112
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,480
Is  that  it  that  was  the  best  demonstration

113
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,759
Resistance!  That's  just  pathetic,  truly.

114
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,980
You're  far  too  soft  and  forgiving!

115
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,899
There's  a  reason  itachi  let  me  live  a  reason  he

116
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,899
chose  me  to  be  the  one  to  track

117
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,720
I

118
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,559
GRRRRRRRR

119
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:58,580


120
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,980
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

121
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,220
Thank  you.

122
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:36,700
S .O .S.

123
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,700
Aaaaah!

124
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:51,500
Set!

125
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,279
Set!

126
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,500
Set!

127
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,679
Aaaaah!

128
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,279
I  can't  move  my  body!

129
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,339
Thank  you.

130
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,759
I  don't  know.

131
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,200
I  don't  know.

132
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,900
Sasuke!

133
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,700
You

134
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
Thank  you.

135
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,819
Those  two.

136
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,039
Thank  you.

137
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,420
Ha!

138
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,559
Thank  you.

139
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,980
Sensei  said  that  Bruiser

140
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,980
What  do  you  want?

141
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,900
outward  appearance  may  be  different  but  he's  the

142
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,880
one  you  know  as  Gaara  my  father

143
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,619
used  ninjutsu  to  ensure  I  be  the  strongest  of

144
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,220
shinobi  infusing  my  unborn

145
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,920
self  with  a  sand  spirit  and  as  a  result  I

146
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,180
birth  to  me.  I  was  born  a  monster.  So  this  is

147
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,880
what  he  was  talking  about!  He

148
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,180
hey  little  girl  hmm  I  guess  now  would  be  the

149
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,980
time  to  tell  you  I'm

150
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,660
You

151
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,980
Sasuke!

152
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,039
Thank  you.

153
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,779
If  you  let  your  hate

154
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,880
of  that  curse  mark.

155
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,460
happens.

156
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,680
I  have  to  get  this  under  control!

157
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,980
So  it's  you  you're  the  one

158
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,640
Huh

159
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,980
myself  as  long  as

160
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,980
Guys  get  up  we  have  to  go

161
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,980
You

162
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,440
No!

163
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,980
Move  it!

164
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,200
Uggggggggggg

165
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,859
You

166
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,079
Let's  go!

167
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,359
now

168
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,819
I  can't  handle  this  guy!

169
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,900
Now  let  me  feel  alive!

170
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,339
you

171
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,039
Thank  you.

172
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,720
Agarra,  you  can't  do  this!

173
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,640
Thank  you.

174
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,079
Thank  you.

175
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,480
Tomorrow!

176
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,579
Medical  Corps,  our  leader,  Lord  Kazekage,  has  asked

177
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:41,980
that  I  see

178
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,039
Yashimaru,  sorry.

179
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,160
The  wound  you  got,  does  it  hurt?

180
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,859
It'll  heal  in  no  time.

181
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
when  someone  is  struck  or  cut

182
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,900
it's  a  feeling  that's  very  hard  to  take.

183
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,779
You  don't  feel  normal.

184
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,240
explaining  it  very  well  basically  it's  a  situation

185
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,980
you  want  to  avoid

186
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,839
Thank  you.

187
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,279
Thank  you.

188
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,420
You're  not  like  me,  Yashimaru?

189
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:26,599
Like  the  others?

190
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,180
You

191
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,880
Hmm

192
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,920
Everyone

193
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,480
But  it's  not  so  easy  for  us  to  hate  one  another.

194
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,039
Thanks  a  lot,  Yashimaru.

195
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,960
That  helped.  I  think  I  kind  of  understand  what

196
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,819
pain  is  now.

197
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,880
I  see.

198
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,700
too.  Just  like  everyone  else.  I'm  always  in  pain.

199
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,779
You

200
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,420
Thank  you.

201
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,539
Thank  you.

202
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,720
Thank  you.

203
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,039
Thank  you.

204
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,200
Love.

205
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,799
You've  got  it.

206
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,779
Love  is  the  heart's  desire.

207
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,900
My

208
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
death,  wants  more  than  anything  to  protect  you.

209
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:36,720
Yashimaru...

210
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,240
What  is  it,  Gaara?

211
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,140
Thank  you  for  all  of  your  help.

212
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,480
You're  very  welcome.

213
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,799
After  all,

214
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,940
Okay.

215
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,140
Thank  you.

216
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,619
I

217
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,960
I  have  a  feature.

218
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,799
I  need  some  of  your  medicine.

219
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,980
Ha,  ha,  ha,  ha.

220
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,279
Woof,  woof,  woof,  woof.

221
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,500
Woof,  woof,  woof.

222
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,920
Thank  you.

223
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,920
No  one  wants

224
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,980
why  why  do  I  have  to  be  such  a

225
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,519
Thank  you.

226
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,619
.

227
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,619
Why?

228
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,859
Is  it  always  me?

229
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,619
Thank  you.

230
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,900
Who  are  they?

231
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,039
Thank  you.

232
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,359
Thank  you.

233
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,920
to  serve  someone

234
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,920
Well,  I  wouldn't...

235
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,500
to  have  you.

236
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,599
Sacrifice.

237
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,880
Your  name  is  the

238
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,980
A  demon  that  loves  you.

239
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,639
No  one's  existence.

240
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,500
gift.

241
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,260
out  of  maternal  affection.

242
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:26,980
It  was  from  her  undying  rage  at  this

243
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,179
No!

244
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,599
Whoa!

245
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,500
Thank  you.

246
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,039
Thank  you.

247
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:56,880
You  were  never  loved,  Gaara.

248
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,840
Never.

249
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,880
but  now

250
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,139
You

251
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,800
Thank  you.

252
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,079
Thank  you.

253
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,500
Oh

254
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,500
Love?

255
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,980
The  sand  ought  to

256
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,980
the  love  of  a  mother.  I  believe  your  mother

257
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,400
grain  of  that  sand.

258
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,480
were  the

259
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,980
kind  of

260
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,460
.

261
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,179
I  love  you,  I  love  you,  I  love  you.

262
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,340
Thank  you.

263
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,699
Love  no  one  else.

264
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,980
Only  for  yourself.

265
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,840
And  now...

266
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,780
without  Mooji  Media  Ltd.'s  express  consent.

267
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,420
What's  the  matter?

268
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,860
Don't  you  care  what  happens  to  your  precious

269
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,079
Let  her  go!

270
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,980
Bye.

271
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,980
You  don't  matter!

272
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,980
It's  time!

273
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,159
Whoa!

274
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,780
Summoning  Jutsu!

275
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,199
What  is  it?  What  do  you  want,  kid?

276
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,920
Well,  whatever  it  is,  I  hope  you  brought  along

277
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,340
some  treats.

278
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,579
Oh,  give  me  a  break!

279
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,980
I'm  really  starting  to  hate  you!

280
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,139
Well,  take  that,  you  big  bigot!

281
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:00,699
Listen!

282
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,360
I  can't  believe  it!

283
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,500
work  I'm  the  only  one  who  can  save  them  worried

284
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,519
about  the  others

285
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,920
When  I

286
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,780
alone

287
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,300
Thank  you.

288
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,739
And  you  should  hurry!

289
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,980
until  you

290
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,480
SAN  SURIKEN!

291
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,300
Ah!

292
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,420
Ah!

293
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:15,940
No!

294
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,039
Thank  you.

295
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,639
I've  seen  that  look  before.

296
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:42,480
In  myself.

297
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,519
Like  me!

298
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:02,800
I  remember  how  I  hated  them  because  they  hated  me

299
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,139
and  I  couldn't  understand  why.

300
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:07,900
I  wondered  why  I  even  existed.

301
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:11,099
The  fox  spirit  that  killed  Iruka's  parents  and

302
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,699
destroyed  our  village  has  taken  over  your  body.

303
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,900
That's  when  I  found  out

304
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,880
It  wasn't  my  fault,  but  everyone

305
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,380
But  then...

306
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:40,199
Hey,  how  about  we  take  a  ramen  break,  Naruto?

307
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:42,539
Yeah!  Great  idea!

308
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,699
right  now!

309
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,900
he  feels  about  me

310
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,980
Ramen  Beans  and

311
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,139
stuff  like  this.

312
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,579
I  made  it  better.

313
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,980
Then  even  though  I  had  this  monster  inside  me

314
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,800
even  though  everyone  else  acted  like  I  didn't

315
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:34,980
exist

316
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,039
in  a  long  time

317
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,699
I'm  really,  really  happy.

318
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,139
They  made  me  glad  to  be  alive

319
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,880
But  when  I  think  back  on  where  I  was  before

320
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,519
nothing  but  pain  and  darkness  what  would  I  be

321
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,739
like  if  I'd  stayed  there  all  alone

322
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,980
I  don't  know.

323
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,980
That's  why  he  hasn't

324
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,539
NO!

325
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,179
Naruto...

326
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,579
What...

327
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:24,639
What  the...

328
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:26,800
And  again!

329
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:42,320
what  is  this  you  come  at  me  and  that's  all

330
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,739
you've  got  all  that  effort

331
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,360
Pfff!

332
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,340
It  doesn't  matter.

333
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,300
Hey!

334
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:17,579
Hey!

335
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,440
I

336
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,980
JOKE!

337
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,739
I'll  call  you  Jiu -Jiu -Jiu!

338
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,679
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

339
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,659
You

340
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:12,980
That  was  a  nice  move  the  kid  pulled

341
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,519
Am  I  not?

342
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:20,860
God,  I...

343
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,840
All  of  that  worked?

344
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,980
Packed  at  the  base  of  the

345
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,880
The  impact.  Have  I  underestimated  him?

346
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Naruto,  listen  to  me.

347
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,619
If  it's  the  last  thing  you  do  once  you've  got

348
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:00,860
her.

349
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,739
It's  all  up  to  you.

350
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,420
Sasuke!

351
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,639
Your  comrades?

352
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:47,760
He's  absolute.

353
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,500
Thank  you.

354
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,079
You

355
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,599
than  I  am.

356
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,760
I  REALLY  DID!

357
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,980
real  strength  is  if  you  never  fight  for  any

358
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,340
So  is  there.

359
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,679
You

360
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,079
HE'S  RELEASING  A  MASSIVE  AMOUNT  OF  CHAKRA!

361
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,360
HOW  IS  HE  DOING  IT?

362
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,300
Thank  you.

363
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,980
MAKVISHA!

364
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,980
LEAVE  MY  EYES

365
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,820
Sasuke,  why  don't  you  take  it  easy  for  a  while?

366
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,639
You  deserve  it!

367
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,800
I  was  a  Maki!

368
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,320

369
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:39,820

372
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,820
My  body  hasn't  recovered  yet  have  to  use  the  sand

373
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,480
to  defend

374
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,480
My  bra!

375
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,780
From  Naruto's  handbook!

376
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,400
That...

377
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:37,920
Kid...

378
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,780
Think  I  will  use  both  legs  for  a  barrage  of  4

379
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,760

381
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,980
Unbelievable  taking  on  God

00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,300
Not  to  him!

00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,860

384
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,980

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,820
He's  finally  emerged.

00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,320
Thank  you.

You  really  are  good  at  amusing  me.

395
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:22,260
Naruto!

396
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,760
BREEZE!

397
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,460
Huh?

398
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:35,980
Not  you!

399
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,719
ZEEEESH!

400
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,260
It's  only  natural  the  boss  would  want  to  help  out

401
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:13,980
his  henchmen,  isn't  it?

402
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,940

403
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,400
OPT!

01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,340
What  are  you  doing  here,  Gamakichi?

01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,800
Came  to  hang  out!

406
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,260

01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,320
kid  than  meets  the  eye.

413
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:06,900
Is  that  right?

414
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:17,920
Okay,  kid,  you're  hereby  accepting

418
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:43,980

419
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,639
Mr.  Flunky!

420
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,179
No!

421
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,159
No!

422
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:54,340
No!

423
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,840
Yeah!

424
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,460
Whoa!

01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,860
Thank  you.

426
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,980
This  guy's  no  joke.

427
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,940
Cut  he  so  heavy,  if  I

428
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:44,980
Hold  on  a  second!

429
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,880

430
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,619
pop  right  kid  I  have  to  take

431
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:01,239
him  out  otherwise  Sakura's  as  good  as  dead

432
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:07,260

433
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,579
Asamaki!

434
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:12,739
This  isn't  good!

435
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,420
He's  really  going  to  do  it!

436
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:16,840
I  have  to  get  out  of  here!

437
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:32,019
What  the...

438
01:03:32,019 --> 01:03:33,780
What  the  heck  is  that?

439
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:37,659
A  spiritualist  medium.

440
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:39,980
To  thank  you!

441
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,679
of  the  manifest

442
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,980
There's  a...

443
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,079
Evidence  that  the  medium's  been  possessed  by  the

444
01:03:59,079 --> 01:03:59,780
Shikaku

445
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,880
by  shikaku

446
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,880
I'm  no  longer  able  to  sleep

447
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,719
The  Chicago

448
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,980
great  but  as  long  as  the  spiritualist  me

449
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,820
The  only  danger.

450
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,539
Vipassum  Jutsu!

451
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,239
Oh

452
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,920
Thank  you.

453
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,599
I  don't  like  this  at  all,  Chief  Toad.  What's

454
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:17,980
gonna  happen?

455
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,980
You

456
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:34,820
I'm  finally  free,  here  I  come!

457
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,260
So  that's  the...

458
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,199
...San  Spirit?

459
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:42,840
Man,  that  is  one  funky  demon!

460
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:43,420
Yeah!

461
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:01,239
Water  style,  liquid  bullets!

462
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,119
Oh,  this  is  nice.  I  didn't  know  it  was  going  to

463
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,539
rain.

464
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:16,500
What  kind  of  a  battle  is  this  turning  into?

465
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,920
Not  in  that  direction!

466
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:23,420
Will  you  shut  up?

467
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,920
HELLBODY!

468
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,699
Thank  you.

469
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
He's  back,  Chief!  There's  one  more  coming!

470
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,659
I  did  it!
